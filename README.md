# Image Text Composer - Starter Scaffold

This is a minimal starter scaffold for the **Image Text Composer** assignment (Next.js + TypeScript).
It contains the core pieces to upload a PNG, add simple text layers (drag / rotate / resize with Konva),
and export the composition. This scaffold is intentionally small so you can expand on it.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

## Notes

- This scaffold uses `react-konva`. See `src/components` for main components.
- It includes autosave, undo/redo skeleton, and export helper.
- You'll need to run `npm install` to fetch dependencies before running.
